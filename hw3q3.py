3. Advanced Slicing Techniques

Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to master the art of slicing in Python lists.

Problem Statement:
You have a list of daily temperatures for a month, and you'd like to extract specific data from it.

Task 1: Given the list of temperatures: * 

temperatures = [72, 75, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106]
Extract the temperatures for the second week (7 days) of the month. Expected Outcome:

83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90,
Task 2: Extract all the temperatures above 100. *

Task 3: Reverse the list and extract temperatures from the 5th to the 10th day of the reversed list. *
